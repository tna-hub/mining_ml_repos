Sequence to Sequence Modeling
==============================

In this project we explain the sequence to sequence modeling using [`Pytorch <https://pytorch.org/>`_].

------------------------------------------------------------
What is the problem?
------------------------------------------------------------

Machine Translation(MT) is one of the areas of NLP that has been profoundly affected by advances in deep learning.
In fact, progress in MT can be categorized into pre-deep learning and deep learning era. Confirmation of this could
be some of the reference books in NLP community such as ”Speech and Language Processing”. Second version of
this book was published in 2008 and chapter 25 is dedicated to machine translation but there is not a single mention of
deep learning usage for MT. However, today we know that the top performing machine translation systems are solely
based on neural networks which led to the term Neural Machine Translation (NMT).

When we use the term neural machine translation, we are talking about applying different deep learning tech-
niques for the task of machine translation. It was after success of neural network in image classification tasks
that researchers started to use neural networks in machine translation. Around 2013 research groups started to achieve
breakthrough results in NMT and boosted state of the art performance. Unlike traditional statistical machine transla-
tion, NMT is based on an end-to-end neural network that increases the performance of machine translation systems.

We dedicate this project to a core deep learning based model for sequence-to-sequence modeling and in particular machine translation: An Encoder-Decoder architecture
based on Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks.

------------------------------------------------------------
What makes the problem a problem?
------------------------------------------------------------

Although sequence to sequence modeling scope is broader than just the machine translation task,
the main focus on seq-2-seq research has been dedicated to MT due to its great importance in real-world
problems. Furthermore, machine translation is the bridge for a universal human-machine conversation.

------------------------------------------------------------
What is the secret sauce here?
------------------------------------------------------------

Here, we tried to achieve some primary goals as we hope to make this work unique compared to the many other available tutorials:

  1. We called this repo ``"from scratch"`` due to the fact that we do NOT consider
  any background for the reader in terms of implementation.

  2. Instead of using high-level package modules,
  simple RNN architectures are used for demonstration purposes.
  This helps the reader to ``understand everything from scratch``.
  The downside, however, is the relatively low speed of training.
  This may not cause any trouble as we try to train a very small model.

  3. The difference between ``uni-directional LSTMs`` and ``bi-directional LSTMs``
  have been clarified using the simple encoder-decoder implementation.

------------------------------------------------------------
Who cares?
------------------------------------------------------------

It tutorial has been provided for the developers/researchers who really want
to start from scratch and learn everything ``spoon-by-spoon``. The goal is to
give as much detail as possible so the others do NOT have to spend the time to
understand hidden and yet very important details.


============
Model
============

The goal here is to create a **sequence-to-sequence mapping** model which is going to be built on an
Encoder-Decoder network. The model encode the information into a specific representation. This representation
later on will be mapped as a target output sequence. This transition makes the model understand the interoperibility
between two sequences. In another word, the meaningful connection between the two sequence will be created. Two important
sequence to sequence modeling examples are ``Machine Transtional`` and ``Autoencoders``. Here, we can do both just by
chaning the ``input-output`` language sequences.

------------------
Word Embedding
------------------

At the very first step, we should know what are the ``input-output sequences`` and how we should ``represent the data``
for the model to understand it. Clearly, it should be a sequence of words in the input and the equivalent
sequence in the output. In case of having an autoencoder, both input and output sentences
are the same.

A learned representation for context elements is called ``word embedding`` in which the words with similar meaning, ideally,
become highly correlated in the representation space as well. One of the main incentives behind word embedding representations
is the high generalization power as opposed to sparse higher dimensional representation. Unlike the traditional
bag-of-word representation in which different words have quite different representation regardless of their usage,
in learning the distributed representation, the usage of words in the context is of great importance which lead to
similar representation for correlated words in meaning. The are different approaches for creating word embedding. Please
refer to the great Pytorch tutorial titled [`WORD EMBEDDINGS: ENCODING LEXICAL SEMANTICS <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/nlp/word_embeddings_tutorial.html>`_]
for more details.

------------------------------------------------------------
Encoder
------------------------------------------------------------

The encoder generates a single output vector that embodies the input sequence meaning. The general procedure is as follows:

    1. In each step, a word will be fed to a network and it generates an output and a hidden state.
    2. For the next step, the hidden step and the next word will be fed to the same network (W) for updating the weights.
    3. In the end, the last output will be the representative of the input sentence (called the "context vector").

The ``EncoderRNN`` attribute is dedicated to the encoder structure. The Encoder in our code,
can be a ``unidirectional/bidirectional LSTM``. A *Bidirectional* LSTM consists of *two
independent LSTMs*, one take the input sequence in normal time order and the other one
will be fed with the input sequence in the reverse time order. The outputs of the two
will usually be concatenated at each time step (usually the *last hidden states* will be concatenated
and returned). The created feature vector will represents the initial hidden states of the decoder. The
architecture of a bi-lstm is as below:

.. figure:: _img/bilstm.png
   :scale: 50
   :alt: map to buried treasure

**NOTE:** As can be observered in the figure *colors*, two ``independent`` different set of
weights ``MUST`` be considered for the forward and backward passes, Otherwise, the network will
assume the backward pass follows the forward pass!!

The encoder, will generally be initialized as below:

.. code-block:: python

  def __init__(self, hidden_size, input_size, batch_size, num_layers=1, bidirectional=False):
     """
     * For nn.LSTM, same input_size & hidden_size is chosen.
     :param input_size: The size of the input vocabulary
     :param hidden_size: The hidden size of the RNN.
     :param batch_size: The batch_size for mini-batch optimization.
     :param num_layers: Number of RNN layers. Default: 1
     :param bidirectional: If the encoder is a bi-directional LSTM. Default: False
     """
     super(EncoderRNN, self).__init__()
     self.batch_size = batch_size
     self.num_layers = num_layers
     self.bidirectional = bidirectional
     self.hidden_size = hidden_size

     # The input should be transformed to a vector that can be fed to the network.
     self.embedding = nn.Embedding(input_size, embedding_dim=hidden_size)

     # The LSTM layer for the input
     self.lstm = nn.LSTM(input_size=hidden_size, hidden_size=hidden_size, num_layers=num_layers)


**NOTE:** We ``do NOT`` generate the whole LSTM/Bi-LSTM architecture using Pytorch. Instead, we just use
the LSTM cells to represent **what exactly is going on in the encoding/decoding** phases!

The initialization of the LSTM is a little bit different compared to the LSTM
[`Understanding LSTM Netwroks <http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/>`_].
Both cell state and hidden states must be initialized as belows:

.. code-block:: python

  def initHidden(self):

    if self.bidirectional:
        encoder_state = [torch.zeros(self.num_layers, 1, self.hidden_size, device=device),
                                  torch.zeros(self.num_layers, 1, self.hidden_size, device=device)]
        encoder_state = {"forward": encoder_state, "backward": encoder_state}
        return encoder_state
    else:
        encoder_state = [torch.zeros(self.num_layers, 1, self.hidden_size, device=device),
                          torch.zeros(self.num_layers, 1, self.hidden_size, device=device)]
        return encoder_state

As it can be seen in the above code, for the *Bidirectional LSTM*, we have **separate and independent**
states for ``forwards`` and ``backward`` directions.


-----------------------------
Decoder
-----------------------------

For the decoder, the final encoder hidden state (or the concatenation if we have a bi-lstm as the encoder)
of the encoder will be called ``context vector``. This context vector, generated by the encoder, will
be used as the initial hidden state of the decoder. Decoding is as follows:

    1. At each step, an input token and a hidden state is fed to the decoder.

        * The initial input token is the ``<SOS>``.
        * The first hidden state is the context vector generated by the encoder (the encoder's last hidden state).

    2. The first output, should be the first word of the output sequence and so on.
    3. The output token generation ends with ``<EOS>`` being generated or the predefined max_length of the output sentence.

After the first decoder step, for the following steps, the input is going to be the previous word prediction of the RNN.
So the output generation will be upon the network sequence prediction. In case of using ``teacher_forcing``, the input is going to be the actual
targeted output word. It provides better guidance for the training but it is inconsistent with the evaluation stage as
targeted outputs do not exists! In order to handle the issue with this approach, new approaches have been proposed.

The decoder, will generally be initialized as below:

.. code-block:: python

    def __init__(self, hidden_size, output_size, batch_size, num_layers=1):
        super(DecoderRNN, self).__init__()
        self.batch_size = batch_size
        self.num_layers = num_layers
        self.hidden_size = hidden_size
        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(output_size, hidden_size)
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(input_size=hidden_size, hidden_size=hidden_size, num_layers=1)
        self.out = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, input, hidden):
        output = self.embedding(input).view(1, 1, -1)
        output, (h_n, c_n) = self.lstm(output, hidden)
        output = self.out(output[0])
        return output, (h_n, c_n)

    def initHidden(self):
        """
        The spesific type of the hidden layer for the RNN type that is used (LSTM).
        :return: All zero hidden state.
        """
        return [torch.zeros(self.num_layers, 1, self.hidden_size, device=device),
                torch.zeros(self.num_layers, 1, self.hidden_size, device=device)]

-------------------------------
Encoder-Decoder Bridge
-------------------------------

The context vector, generated by the encoder, will be used as the initial hidden state of the decoder.
In case that their *dimension is not matched*, a ``linear layer`` should be employed to transformed the context vector
to a suitable input (shape-wise) for the decoder cell state (including the memory(Cn) and hidden(hn) states).
The shape mismatch is True in the following conditions:

    1. The hidden sizes of encoder and decoder are the same BUT we have a bidirectional LSTM as the Encoder.
    2. The hidden sizes of encoder and decoder are NOT same.
    3. ETC?


The linear layer will be defined as below:

.. code-block:: python

    def __init__(self, bidirectional, hidden_size_encoder, hidden_size_decoder):
        super(Linear, self).__init__()
        self.bidirectional = bidirectional
        num_directions = int(bidirectional) + 1
        self.linear_connection_op = nn.Linear(num_directions * hidden_size_encoder, hidden_size_decoder)
        self.connection_possibility_status = num_directions * hidden_size_encoder == hidden_size_decoder

    def forward(self, input):

        if self.connection_possibility_status:
            return input
        else:
            return self.linear_connection_op(input)

============
Dataset
============

**NOTE:** The dataset object is heavily inspired by the official Pytorch tutorial: [`TRANSLATION WITH A SEQUENCE TO SEQUENCE NETWORK AND ATTENTION <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/seq2seq_translation_tutorial.html/>`_]
The dataset is prepaired using the ``data_loader.py`` script.

At the first state we have to define ``word indexing`` for further processing. The ``word2index`` is the dictionary of
transforming word to its associated index and ``index2word`` does the reverse:

.. code-block:: python

  SOS_token = 1
  EOS_token = 2

  class Lang:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.word2index = {}
        self.word2count = {}
        self.index2word = {0: "<pad>", SOS_token: "SOS", EOS_token: "EOS"}
        self.n_words = 3  # Count SOS and EOS

    def addSentence(self, sentence):
        for word in sentence.split(' '):
            self.addWord(word)

    def addWord(self, word):
        if word not in self.word2index:
            self.word2index[word] = self.n_words
            self.word2count[word] = 1
            self.index2word[self.n_words] = word
            self.n_words += 1
        else:
            self.word2count[word] += 1

Unlike the [`Pytorch tutorial <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/seq2seq_translation_tutorial.html/>`_] we started
the indexing from ``1`` by ``SOS_token = 1`` to have the ``zero reserved``!

In the end, we define a dataset class to handle the processing:

.. code-block:: python

  class Dataset():
      """dataset object"""

      def __init__(self, phase, num_embeddings=None, max_input_length=None, transform=None, auto_encoder=False):
          """
          The initialization of the dataset object.
          :param phase: train/test.
          :param num_embeddings: The embedding dimentionality.
          :param max_input_length: The maximum enforced length of the sentences.
          :param transform: Post processing if necessary.
          :param auto_encoder: If we are training an autoencoder or not.
          """
          if auto_encoder:
              lang_in = 'eng'
              lang_out = 'eng'
          else:
              lang_in = 'eng'
              lang_out = 'fra'
          # Skip and eliminate the sentences with a length larger than max_input_length!
          input_lang, output_lang, pairs = prepareData(lang_in, lang_out, max_input_length, auto_encoder=auto_encoder, reverse=True)
          print(random.choice(pairs))

          # Randomize list
          random.shuffle(pairs)

          if phase == 'train':
              selected_pairs = pairs[0:int(0.8 * len(pairs))]
          else:
              selected_pairs = pairs[int(0.8 * len(pairs)):]

          # Getting the tensors
          selected_pairs_tensors = [tensorsFromPair(selected_pairs[i], input_lang, output_lang, max_input_length)
                       for i in range(len(selected_pairs))]

          self.transform = transform
          self.num_embeddings = num_embeddings
          self.max_input_length = max_input_length
          self.data = selected_pairs_tensors
          self.input_lang = input_lang
          self.output_lang = output_lang

====================
Training/Evaluation
====================

The training/evaluation of this model is done in a not very optimized way deliberately!! The reasons are as follows:

  1. I followed the principle of ``running with one click`` that I personnal have for all my open source projects.
  The principle says: "Everyone must be able to run everything by one click!". So you see pretty much everything in one
  Python file!

  2. Instead of using ready-to-use RNN objects which process mini-batches of data, we input the sequence word-by-word to help
  the readers having a better sense of what is happening behind the doors of seq-to-seq modeling scheme.

  3. For the evaluation, we simply generate the outputs of
  the system based on the built model to see if the model is good enough!


For mini-batch optimization, we input batches of sequences. There is a very important note for the batch feeding. After
inputing each batch element, the ``encoder hidden states`` must be reset. Otherwise, the system may assume the next sequence in a batch follows
the previously processed sequence. It can be seen in the following Python script:


.. code-block:: python

    for step_idx in range(args.batch_size):
      # reset the LSTM hidden state. Must be done before you run a new sequence. Otherwise the LSTM will treat
      # the new input sequence as a continuation of the previous sequence.
      encoder_hidden = encoder.initHidden()
      input_tensor_step = input_tensor[:, step_idx][input_tensor[:, step_idx] != 0]
      input_length = input_tensor_step.size(0)


====================

Some sample results for autoencoder training are as follows:
