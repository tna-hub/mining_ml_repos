Till now, the app takes as input the 'data/datasetv1.csv' file, extract the relevant elements (files an commits), then save it to the database.

To execute:
1. Open 'config.ini' in the data folder and edit your postgresql database connection details and your github token
2. Run the file init_db.py (python3 db_ini.py).
3. Start the extraction by running extractor.py.
4. Now wait. It takes a while. We should consider splitting the work. Each one choosing a range of rows in the dataset (delete all the lines not needed) before running init_db.py

After this, all the necessary data will be in the database. Only the analysis is left.
